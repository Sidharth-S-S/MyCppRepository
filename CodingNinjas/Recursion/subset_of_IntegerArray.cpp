/***
You need to save all the subsets in the given 2D output array. And return the number of subsets(i.e. number of rows filled in output) from the given function.

In ith row of output array, 1st column contains length of the ith subset. And from 1st column actual subset follows.
For eg. Input : {1, 2}, then output should contain 
	{{0}, 		// Length of this subset is 0
	{1, 2},		// Length of this subset is 1
	{1, 1},		// Length of this subset is also 1
	{2, 1, 2}}	// Length of this subset is 2

Donâ€™t print the subsets, just save them in output.

 * Assume the problem has 2 parts 1 part is handled by recursion and the output is already printed.
 * e.g. Elements are  let  6,7,8 => Recursion is handling 7,8 and the output is  0 [] , 1 7 , 1 8 , 2 7 8
 * now during the small calculation we need to handle 6 , so create a copy of all the 4 output .
 * in the index add +1 and in the array element add 6 at the next array idx . 
 * e.g. 0 [] now 0+1 and at the 1st idx add 6 => 1 6 ;;;; similarly
 * 1 7 => idx 1 has 7 now  at the 0th idx add +1 and at 2nd idx add 6 => 2 7 6 ;; so on
