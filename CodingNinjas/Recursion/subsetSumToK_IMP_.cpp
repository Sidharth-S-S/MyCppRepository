/***
You need to save all the subsets in the given 2D output array. 
And return the number of subsets(i.e. number of rows filled in output) from the given function.

In ith row of output array, 1st column contains length of the ith subset. And from 1st column actual subset follows.
For eg. Input : {1, 3, 4, 2} and K = 5, then output array should contain
	{{2, 1, 4},	// Length of this subset is 2
	{2, 3, 2}}	// Length of this subset is 2

Donâ€™t print the subsets, just save them in output.

/****************************************************************
 * Quite complex approach is here for this logic ; however the aim is that the sum of the numbers will be k ;
 * let the array we will take is 1 ,3 ,4, 2 k = 5 => there is a chance to include 1 or not based on that let 
 * 1 is not included => 3 , 4 , 2 and k = 5  will give output ass 3 + 2 
 * if 1 is included then k = 5-1 = 4 ; from 3,4,2 we can consider either to include 3 ; if include 3 => Output size = 0 but elements are 2 , 1 , 3 and k= 4-3 = 1; 
 * now we can not include 2 as  k < 2 ; hence if we do not include 2 , array size becomes 0 and k != 0 so The Output array is wrong and just return 0 from this loop
 * 
 * once 3 include is wrong next we have to include the next index i.e. 4 ; Output is 1,4 k = 4-4=0; Now return 1 and update the array 1st Col with proper size.
